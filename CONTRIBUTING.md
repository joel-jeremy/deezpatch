# Contributing Guidelines

First of all, thank you for having the interest in contributing to this project!

## Found a bug?

Please create an issue describing the following:

- The version the bug was discovered.
- A scenario to reproduce the bug.

## Enhancement ideas?

Got an idea to enhance the library? Please feel free to create an issue describing the feature proposal. Any ideas are welcome! :)

## Pre-requisites

To be able to work on this project, the following software needs to be installed on your machine:

- Java (>= 11)
- Docker (Rancher Desktop or Docker Desktop)
  - For integration tests
- Git

## Build

To build the project, run the command:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

> The above command will check code format, build all the projects, and run unit and integration tests. It will also generate test report and jacoco test coverage report.

## Test Runs

Running tests is as simple as:

```sh
./gradlew build
```

This will run unit and integration tests of all the projects.

Integration tests usually takes longer to complete than unit tests. In cases where integration tests are not required, it can be excluded by:

```sh
./gradlew build -x integrationTest
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Format

The project adheres to the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

To easily fix code formatting warning/errors, the Spotless Gradle plugin can be used to apply [Google Java Format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format). Just run the commands:

- `./gradlew build` to check for formatting errors.
  - The `skipSpotlessCheck` property can be set to skip Spotless' code format check e.g. `./gradlew build -PskipSpotlessCheck`
- `./gradlew spotlessApply` to automatically fix formatting errors.

CheckStyle extension/plugin can also be installed to your favorite IDE ([VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shengchen.vscode-checkstyle), [IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065-checkstyle-idea), [Eclipse](https://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs/#!/)) to highlight code when it does not adhere to [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) (see [CheckStyle Google Style Docs](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/google_style.html) and [google_checks.xml](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml)).

### Git Branching Strategy

The project follows the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) branching strategy.

### Unit Test Structure

Unit tests in this project follow a specific structure.

- Classes must have a corresponding test class i.e. `Deezpatch` -> `DeezpatchTests`. The test class must be in the exact same java package as the class it corresponds to.
- Test classes are nested in structure. Each method in the class under test must have a corresponding `@Nested` test class.
- Each `@Nested` test class must test scenarios that is supported by the method it corresponds to via `@Test`.
- Use `@DisplayName` to describe the scenario being tested by the `@Test` method e.g. `@DisplayName("should throw when x argument is null)`.

    ```java
    // Class under test: io.github.joeljeremy.deezpatcher.core.Deezpatch
    public class Deezpatch implements Dispatcher, Publisher {
        public Deezpatcher(...) {
            ...
        }
        
        public <T extends Request<R>, R> Optional<R> send(T request) {
            ...
        }

        public <T extends Event> void publish(T event) {
            ...
        }

        public static class Builder {
            ...
            public Deezpatcher build() {
                ...
            }
        }
    }

    // Test class: io.github.joeljeremy.deezpatch.core.DeezpatchTests
    class DeezpatchTests {
        @Nested
        class Constructors {
            // @Test methods here...
        }

        @Nested
        class SendMethod {
            // @Test methods here...
        }

        @Nested
        class PublishMethod {
            // @Test methods here...
        }

        // Nested class must also have corresponding test classes
        @Nested
        class BuilderTests {
            ...
            @Nested
            class BuildMethod {
                // @Test methods here...
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## Release Guidelines

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

When releasing, the following steps must be followed:

1. Create a release and tag via GitHub Releases e.g. `1.0.0`.
    - The release description should include a changelog.
2. After release pipeline completes, bump up the version in root `build.gradle` to the next development version by creating a pull request.
    - By default, the next development version is a minor version bump i.e. `1.0.0` --> `1.1.0`.
3. Merge the pull request to `main`.
